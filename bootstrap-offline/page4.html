      <h1><b>What is Cyberbullying?</b></h1>
      <div class="desc1">Bullying is when someone says or does something unkind or unsafe to someone else.
      When bullying happens on a device, like a computer or mobile phone, this is often called cyberbullying or online bullying. Cyberbullying also includes photos, messages, or pages that don't get taken down, even after the person has been asked to do so. In other words, it's anything that gets posted online and is meant to hurt, harass, or upset someone else.

    <div class="container-fluid" id="tip2">
      <h1><b>What are Common Signs?</b></h1>
      <div class="desc2"><u>Someone is bullying you online if they do one or more of the following:</u> <br>

        <li>Call you names.<br></li>
        <li>Say rude, nasty or mean things about you to other people. <br></li>
        <li>Spread rumours or lies about you to other people.<br></li>
        <li>Make you feel unsafe.<br></li>
        <li>Make you feel embarrassed.<br></li>
        <li>Keep contacting you when you don’t want them to.<br></li>
        <li>Share pictures or videos of you that you don’t like.<br></li>
        <li>Pretend to be you to make you look bad<br></li><br><br>
        <div class="desc2pt5">Intimidation or mean comments that focus on things like a person's gender, religion, sexual orientation,
           race, or physical differences count as discrimination, which may be against the law.</div>

    <div class="container-fluid" id="tip3">
      <h1><b>What can you do?</b></h1>
      <div class="desc3"><u>Get help if it happens to you:</u><br>

        <li>Talk to someone you trust, like staff at a centre or group you attend, your family or a friend.<br></li>
          <li>Save messages and images. Take a screenshot, or ask someone else to do it for you.<br></li>
            <li>Report it to the social media app or website where it happened. You can ask someone else to help if you don’t know how.<br></li>
              <li>Ask for help to block any phone numbers that are being used to send you nasty messages.<br></li>
                <li>Contact Netsafe for advice.<br></li>
                Online bullying is not okay, and if you feel as though you are feeling the impacts of it, don't be scared or hesitate to reach out for help. The man who speaks up is a fool minute, but the man who does not is a fool for a lifetime.
